# DESC: Leveraging Homegrown Tools to Enhance the Hacker Experience üå±

I was recently given the honor of giving a workshop talk at [Major
League Hacking's|https://mlh.io] 2024 [Hackcon|https://hackcon.mlh.io/].
The topic of my talk was centered around design methodologies for building
homegrown tools for hackathon events.

- Peruse the [slide deck|$/slides/art_of_the_discord_bot_deck.pdf].
- Check out [helper duck|https://github.com/alexacallmebaka/helper-duck], one of HackKU's homegrown tools.

Happy hacking! üçª
