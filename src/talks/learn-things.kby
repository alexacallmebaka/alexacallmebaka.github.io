Lately, many people have been asking me the question, "How did you learn to do X thing"?
Initially, this was a hard question for me to answer... how /did/ I learn how to do that?!
There are a lot of things I certainly didn't learn in school or from an online course.

This Fall, I was given the honor of giving one of ACM@KU's lightning talks. For my talk,
I wanted to give an overview of the various resources, philosophies, people, and experiences that have
taught me everything I know and fed my passion for programming outside the classroom.
