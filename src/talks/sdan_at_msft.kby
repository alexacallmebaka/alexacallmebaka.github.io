# DESC: Enabling Virtualized Networking in Azure! ☁️

In February of 2026, I had the absolute pleasure of delivering both an industry spotlight to my beloved [ACM@KU|https://kuacm.club/] (who gave me a [very warm welcome back|https://www.instagram.com/p/DUl9bwMj8sb/]) as well as a guest lecture for KU's senior design class for computer science and 
cybersecurity engineering students. As I write this, I feel very grown-up despite still feeling like a kid wearing his dad's suit everytime I set
foot in my office. I gave a version of the same talk at both events, as the overlap was minimal and both speaking prompts were similar.
