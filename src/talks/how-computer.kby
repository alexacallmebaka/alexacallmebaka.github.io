# DESC: The Basics of Computing for Scientists

For my first talk as a KU alumnus, I had the pleasore of presenting to
KU's chapter of [The Society of Physics Students (SPS)|https://www.instagram.com/physicsatkansas/].
In this talk, I cover the basics of computing to best prepare budding
physcists and astronomers to do research using high-performance computing
tools, as well as think about /what/ their code is doing so that they
can write more effiecent programs.
