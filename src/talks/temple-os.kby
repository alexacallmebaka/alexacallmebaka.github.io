For my final ACM@KU student spotlight, I felt it appropriate to "run it back" as the kids say and give the same talk I
did for my first spotlight: a tour of TempleOS. TempleOS is the creation [Terry Davis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis],
and is his interpretation of what he believed to be a message from God after a manic episode. The message was simple, build a temple to the lord in the form of an operating system. In this talk I covered the history of one pious man's livelihood, as well as gave a live
demo of the software in action!
