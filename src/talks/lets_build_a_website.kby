# DESC: Your one-stop shop for the third workshop in the HackKU24 Beginner's Series! 🛍️

I gave this talk as the third installment of our Beginner
's Series for HackKU24. 
In it, I teach HTML, CSS, and Flask 
to an audience of beginner programmers. Building on a Figma 
prototype from the previous HackKU Beginner's workshop, I walk hackers through 
creating a simple sign-in page that displays who has signed-in 
so far after a user fills in a form.
