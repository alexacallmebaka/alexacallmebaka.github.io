# DESC: Conquer the web with Kobayashi, the internet's most draconic static site builder! üêâ

Hello, and welcome the user manual for the Kobayashi static website builder! Named 
after [my favorite two-dimensional programmer|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Kobayashi%27s_Dragon_Maid]
and written in Haskell, Kobayashi is designed for the
creation of simple static websites (like this one!) and consists of the `kby` markup format which the 
`kobayashi` static website builder translates to `html` files for you to display on the World Wide Web!

All the examples used in the manual can be found on [GitHub|https://github.com/alexacallmebaka/kobayashi/tree/master/examples].

@ Getting Kobayashi üñãÔ∏è

Currently, GNU\/Linux (pick your favorite flavor) and MacOS are the only officially support operating systems.
Kobayashi /might/ work on Windows, but it is uncharted territory as of now.

Kobayashi is written in Haskell, and requires version `9.10.1` of the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler|https://www.haskell.org/ghc/]
and version `3.10.1.0` of [The Haskell Cabal|https://www.haskell.org/cabal/]. Other versions of these libraries
could work, but your mileage my vary. The recommend way to install both `ghc` and `cabal` is to use the
[`GHCup` utility|https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/].

The Kobayashi source code is freely available on [GitHub|https://github.com/alexacallmebaka/kobayashi] and 
the `master` branch can be cloned for a stable release. After cloning the source code, simply run
`cabal update` followed by `cabal install` to build and install the `kobayashi` site builder on your system!

After that, it's time to build your website!

@Hello, Kobayashi! üôã

As previously mentioned, the content of a Kobayashi site is defined using the `kby` markup format. `kby` files
end in, you probably guessed it, `.kby`. The file extension is case-insensitive, but it is important that
the file extension of each page on your site contains those three letters. *`kobayashi` will ignore any files
given to it that do not end in `.kby`*.

As a very simple example, let us create the classic "hello, world!" example. In a file called 
`hello_world.kby` we can put the following.

```
#Hello, world!

Check out my cool page. üòé
```

After that, run `kobayashi build hello_world.kby` and watch the magic happen! You'll notice, `kobayashi`
has a lot to say about our simple little file

```
$ kobayashi build hello_world.kby

kobayashi.toml not found!

[Current Configuration]
Build Directory: "build/"
Assets Directory: "/media/"
Path to CSS: "/style.css"

Starting build of hello_world.kby
Building hello_world.kby...

Finished in 0.0013 sec with 0 error(s).
```

most of this we can ignore for now, but notice two things:

  - `kobyashi` logs to the terminal which files it builds.
  - The build directory is `build/`.

`kobayashi` will output the `html` files for your site in a separate folder called the *build directory*.
This folder is created if it doesn't exist, and by default is just `build` in the current working
directory.

Let us explore what `kobayashi` cooked up for us,

```
$ tree build
 
build/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello_world
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html

2 directories, 1 file
```

you'll see that a folder with the name of the original `kby` file was made, and inside sits a file called
`index.html` which contains the `html` that was generated. Kobayashi organizes things this way so you can
link a specific page on your site by using just the filenames and not having the fumble around with
remembering extensions. For example, we could link to our "hello, world!" page with `https://mysite/hello_world`.

Finally, let's look at the contents of `index.html`

```
$ cat build/hello_world/index.html

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!--Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è using Kobayashi: https://github.com/alexacallmebaka/kobayashi-->
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />
<title>Hello, world!</title>
</head>
<html>
<body>
<article id="hello-world">
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>
Check out my cool page. üòé
</p>
</article>
</body>
</html>
```

As you can see, `kobayashi` automatically sets some helpful metadata for us, as well as links in a 
stylesheet (more on this later). This also demonstrates what the `#` does in `kby` markup -- it sets
the title of the page as well as the main heading! With this simple example under our belt, let's
dive a but deeper into the `kby` spec.

@The Anatomy of a `kby` File üß¨
In its most basic form, a `kby` file consists of a *title* followed by a list of *block elements*. The title
is a series of *in-line elements* prefixed by a `#` and ended by a newline. 
For example `#Hello, world!` was the title of our page in
the previous example. In `html`, the title of a page is used three ways:

- Wrapped in `<h1>` tags at the top of the page.
- The literal text of the title (with no extra styling) is used in the `<title>` element of the `html` page.
- An alphanumeric version of the title (with spaces replaced by hyphens) is used as the id of the `article` tag that wraps the main content of the document.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! What about block and in-line elements? Well, *block elements* are elements one would traditionally expect to use the 
`block` display mode in `html`. The block elements in `kby` are:

- Paragraphs
- Bulleted lists
- Code listings
- Block quotes
- Images
- Element groups

*Each of these is ended by two newlines.*
We will explore these more in [their own section|#block-elements]. As for in-line elements, our star-studded cast is as follows

- Bold text
- Italic text
- Verbatim text
- Links

These also will have their [own section|#inline-elements] coming up soon.

@ Block Elements üß±
The first and most basic of the block elements is the *paragraph*. The paragraph is simply defined as a sequence of in-line
elements and plain text ended by two newlines. Making a paragraph is easy, just type out the words! The body of our page
in [the "hello, world!" example|#hello-kobayashi] was a paragraph in action. In `html`, we simply wrapped the content of
a paragraph in `<p>` tags.

Next up, we have *bulleted lists*! An example of a bulleted list is

```
some music genres I like:

- j-pop
- midwest emo
- shoegaze
- k-pop
- bitpop
```

Above, we see a paragraph followed by a bulleted list. Each item in the list is prefixed by a `-` and can contain any
sequence of plain text and in-line elements.  In the `html`, we use the classic `<ul>` for the whole list and `<li>` for each item.
A given item is ended by a newline, and the entire list is ended by two newlines
(one to end the final item, and another to end the list).

At this point it is worth noting that *every block element is ended by two newlines, unless it is at the end of the file.* If it is the
last block element in the file, then no newlines are required (unless your editor does not automatically end files with newlines, than
one newline may be required for something like a list).


Next up, *code listings*! Let's see an example.

```
\`\`\`
def function():
  print("turing could never.")
\`\`\`
```

Code listings are simply blocks that display whatever text is inside them verbatim (with a small exception). You begin a code listing using
`\`\`\`` followed by a newline, and then end it with the same three backticks followed by two newlines. Everything in-between will be translated
verbatim into `html` and wrapped in `<pre>` and `<code>` tags (in that order). Well, almost verbatim. One special case to watch out for
is if you use three or more `\`` in a row in your listing. Since this contains the marker that ends a verbatim block, these characters need to
be *escaped*. We will see escaping much more in the section on in-line elements, but it essentially tells `kobayashi` to interpret a character
literally, stripping away any special semantic meaning it use to hold. To escape a backtick, prefix it with a `\\`. So, if you wanted to
type `\`\`\`` you's need to put `\\\`\\\`\\\`` in your code listing. Also, if you want to include the escape character itself, you will
need to escape that too. So to type a `\\` you will need to use `\\\\`.

Onwards now, to *block quotes*. As always, an example first.

```
> If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter. ~Mark Twain
```

Block quotes are best used when you are looking to quote somebody or a text directly. It begins with a `>`, some number of
in-line elements, a `~` and then the author of whatever you are quoting as a series of in-line elements ended by, or course, two newlines. 
When translated to `html`, the whole thing is a `<div>` tag
with the class `blockquote`. Inside this the quote itself is wrapped in `<span>` tags with the class `quote` and the author is
similarly wrapped in `<span>` tags with the class `author`.

The last two elements we will cover are somewhat different from the rest. The first are *images*. An image in `kby` markup is
a link enclosed in angle brackets ended by two newlines. The link can take two forms, it can either link to an *asset* or a *remote image*.

First, let's look at linking to an asset.

```
<$/path/to/my/image.jpeg>
```

The link inside the angle brackets is prefixed by a `$/` which is a reference to your project's *assets directory*. Essentially, this is
a folder located somewhere relative to the root of your site that contains all non-kby files relevant to your site (it can also contain
`kby` files, but `kobayashi` will ignore them). By default, this directory
is called `media` and located at the root of your site. As we will see later, this directory is user-configurable. After placing the `$/`,
you can type the path as you would on any unix-y system. 
 
The other option is to link to something remotely. Here is an example.

```
<https://jameshurd.net/media/casitas_1.jpeg>
```

In the `html`, `kobayashi` uses `<img>` tags for images, and in the case of remote links whatever you type will be used verbatim
as the `href` attribute.

Last, but certainly not least, we have *element groups*. Among the block elements, these are the biggest outliers and their utility may not
be apparent initially. Element groups allow you to group various other block elements and wrap them in `<div>` tags in the resulting
`html`. An example is as follows.

```
{my_group}

all of this fun stuff belongs together!

- here is
- a list of fun stuff

a fun bash program:

\`\`\`
:(){ :|:& };:
\`\`\`

{my_group}
```

Please do not run the code in the previous example, it may or may not crash your computer... Anyways! Above we grouped together a code listing,
a list, and a couple of paragraphs. For groups, you start them by wrapping the name of your group in curly braces. You then do the same thing
when you are ready to end your group. This will wrap all the `html` for the elements in your group in `<div>` tags with a class name
that mirrors the group name. Group names can consist of any combination of alphanumeric characters, `_`, and `-`.

In the above example, our group's name is `my_group`, so all of those elements will be contained in the element `<div class="my_group">`.

Groups can get very messy very fast. In fact, if you want to melt your brain, you can arbitrarily nest groups inside of each other! Just
make sure to properly sequence your starting and ending markers...

Another weird point about groups they are the only block elements that do not need to be ended by a double newline, just a single one will
do (or the end of the file).

@ In-Line Elements üö¢
Another fundamental building block of `kby` markup is the in-line element! These elements, as you probably guessed, occur on the same
line within [block elements|#block-elements]. Mainly, they are used for different styles of text. Specifically,

- /bold text/ is wrapped in `*` and translates to the `<strong>` tag in `html`.
- /italic text/ is wrapped in `/` and translates to the `<em>` tag in `html`.
- /verbatim text/ is wrapped in `\`` and translates to the `<code>` tag in `html`.

It is worth mentioning that bold and italic text can also be nested within each other. Verbatim can also sit within bold and italic text,
but not the other way around (i.e. `*\`bold verb\`*` => *`bold verb`* but `\`*bold verb*\`` => `*bold verb*`).

Another important thing to note is the notion of *escape characters*. Since the `*`, `/`, and `\`` characters hold special styling information,
if you want to display them as part of a sequence of in-line elements.
(e.g. in a paragraph)  you will need to prefix them with a `\\` to strip that information away and display them literally.
Since the `\\` also serves a special purpose (stripping away that info), you also need to escape it to type it literally (i.e. `\\\\` => \\).

Since verbatim text does not contain any in-line elements, you need not escape the usual styling characters from its contents.
However, you will need to escape `\`` and `\\`.

The last in-line element is one that is fundamental to any website ‚Äî the *hyperlink*. Syntactically, links take the following form.

```
[title|href]
```

In `html`, links get implemented with `<a>` tags.
The `title` portion of the link can be any valid sequence of in-line elements, and is the text that is clickable on the page (i.e. what is
wrapped in the `<a>` tag in `html`). The `href` portion is what the link points to, and is used to fill the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag.
`href`s come in three main flavors:

- Links to pages
- Links to assets
- Links to remote resources

Firstly, if the link begins with `/`, `.`, `..`, or `#` `kobayashi` will interpret as a link to a page on your site, and give the 
`<a>` tag the class `local-page` All four of these markers carry the same meaning they do in `html`, mainly:

- `/` refers to the root of your site.
- `.` refers to the current directory.
- `..` refers to one directory back.
- `#` refers to the `id` attribute of a specific element (more on this when we get to [sections|#organizing-your-kby-with-sections]).

Next, as with images, links that start with `$/` refer to your site's assets directory (where relevant non-`kby` files are stored).
By default, this is a folder called `media` at the root of your site. These links have the class `local-asset`.

Finally, links that start with anything else are interpreted as links to remote resources, and have the class `remote`.

@ Organizing Your `kby` With Sections üóÑÔ∏è
At this point, we have all the building blocks to start creating a cozy little blog! However, it would be nice if we could
give our pages a bit more structure... that is where *sections* come in!

Sections are a construct that allow us to group sequences of block elements into named, /linkable/ groups.
They begin on their own line with a `@` and then contain a sequence of in-line elements ended by a new line.
Let's see an example.

```
#My cooler site üî•

Hello! Welcome to my slick blog.

@Awesome Section
Wow, look at how organized I am!

@Awesomer Section
This really does spark joy.
```

[Marie Kondo|https://konmari.com/about-marie-kondo/] would be so proud of us right now. If we look at the `html` generated by this example
(sans the `<head>` boilerplate) we can see what sections are doing.

```
<html>
<body>
<article id="my-cooler-site">
<h1>My cooler site üî•</h1>
<p>
Hello! Welcome to my slick blog.
</p>
<section id="awesome-section">
<h2>Awesome Section</h2>
<p>
Wow, look at how organized I am!
</p>
</section>
<section id="awesomer-section">
<h2>Awesomer Section</h2>
<p>
This really does spark joy.
</p>
</section>
</article>
</body>
</html>
```

Several things to note here. Firstly, we can see that each section wraps its contents in `<section>` tags, that have an `id` attribute
consisting of the alphanumeric text of the title minus any styling information, with spaces replaced by `-`. The `id` will also
be all lowercase and strip any leading or trailing whitespace. *If you want to create a link to a specific section of a page, you
can use this `id`*!

You can also see that each section begins with an `<h2>` tag that contains the text of the section title.

The last important thing to notice is where the sections begin and end. Before the first declaration of a section,
the elements are not in any `<section>` tags. This area is called the *anonymous section* and is where everything sits by default.
A page need not have any sections, but once the first section is declared, everything that follows is a part of that section until
a new section is declared. In other words, *sections are ended by other sections*. It is also worth mentioning that *once you leave
the anonymous section, there is no way to go back*.

@ Styling With `css` üé® 
At this point, we are now able write our site using the glorious `kby` markup, and have `kobayashi` spit out a bunch of `html` files for
us to display to the world. There is only one problem... we currently have no way to change how our website is displayed, we are stuck
with the default styling. Lucky for us, `kobayashi` gives us the option to specify our own custom `css` stylesheet!

For the uninitiated, `css` is a language used to style `html` elements. Teaching `css` is out of the scope of this manual,
but a great place to get started with `css` is to read
[Mozilla's tutorials|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Tutorials].

By default, `kobayashi` looks for a file called `style.css` at the root of our site. As we will see later in the section on
[project configuration|#project-configuration-with-toml], this can be changed to wherever your heart desires.

For the `html` that corresponds to each `kby` element, see the previous sections on [block elements|#block-elements],
[in-line elements|#inline-elements] and [sections|#organizing-your-kby-with-sections].

@ Building a Multi-Page Website üìë
So far, we have only seen examples of using `kobayashi` to build a single `kby` file. However, `kobayashi` can build a whole folder
of `kby` files in one go! The secret to this is to simply pass the name of the directory that contains all of the files instead of the
path to a specific file.

As we saw earlier, `kobayashi` will create a folder called `build` in whatever directory you invoke it from. `kobayashi` will then
replicate the directory structure of the source folder in build, replacing files with their `html` counterparts as we saw in
the ["hello, world!" example|#hello-kobayashi] with one notable exception. Normally, a file called `myFile.kby` corresponds to
`myFile/index.html`, but if the filename is `index.kby` it will be translated to `index.html` in its directory with no extra folder.
This is behavior is a must for navigation or home pages.

@ Project Configuration ü™õ 
So, we have all the ingredients to build our website with Kobayashi, but what if we don't like the default options?
Well, Kobayashi lets you customize several things about your project! The first one being the *build directory*.
By default, the `html` files for your site are placed in a folder called `build`, however you can specify what ever output folder
you like by passing the `-odir` option to `kobayashi` followed by the *relative path* to your output folder. *This path must be
relative, otherwise `kobayashi` will ignore it and use the next choice for the build directory*. If the folder does not exist,
`kobayashi` will create it for you (including any missing parent directories)!

In `kobayashi`, options are placed before the command (`build` in most cases). To see an example, let's say we wanted to 
the ["hello, world!" example|#hello-world] to be built in the folder `tmp/hello_world`. We would pass this as

```
$ kobayashi -odir tmp/hello_world build hello_world.kby
```

*If you every forget an option, simply run `kobayashi help` and the builder will gladly remind you of everything it can do.*

Kobayashi will also let you specify custom paths for the *assets directory* and *stylesheet*. Instead of being passed via the command line,
this are set in a configuration file using [`toml`|https://toml.io/en/], specifically version 0.5.0 of the specification. If you are
unfamiliar withe `toml`, check out the [offical documentation|https://toml.io/en/v0.5.0].

By default, `kobayashi` will look for a file called `kobayashi.toml` in the current working directory. You can also specify the path to a 
different file using the `-cfg` option. A typical configuration file looks like this

```
[project]
build_dir = "build"
assets_dir = "/media"
css_path = "/style.css"
favicon_path = "/favicon.ico"
```

As you can see, you can also specify the build directory here.
The main table must be called *project*, and the keys are pretty self-explanatory. As usual, a couple things to note here.

- `build_dir` *must* be a relative path.
- `assets_dir`, `css_path`, and `favicon_path` *must* be absolute paths.

That second one is a bit of a lie. They must be absolute paths where `/` represents the build directory of your site.
As an example, if I want my site's assets directory to be `build/stuff` I would set `assets_dir` to `/stuff`.

*If either of these criteria is not met, `kobayashi` will ignore that key in the `toml` file and use the default.* Each time it runs,
`kobayashi` will begin by displaying the current configuration information so you can verify everything is correct.

The last thing to talk about in terms of configuration is *precedence*. `kobayashi` will first use any of the options passed to it
via the command line, then check the configuration file, and lastly fill in with defaults.

@Adding a Navigation Bar üß≠
An important piece of many websites is having a navigation bar (navbar) on top. In Kobayashi, navbars are optional and will appear below the title of the page.
The contents of the navbar are specified within the `[project]` table in the `toml` configuration file as a list of tables with the `navbar` key.
An example is as follows,

```
[project]
navbar = [ { name = "home üè†", src = "/" }
         , { name = "my cool music üé∑", src = "/music" }
         ]
```

Each table has two keys, the first being `name`, which is what text is displayed in the navbar for that link. This can be any valid sequence 
of [in-line elements|#inline-elements]. The second is `src`, which is the URL the link will take the user to when clicked.
This can be any URL valid within a `kby` link.

In terms of `html`, the contents of the navbar is a set of `<ul>` tags where each `<li>` contains an `<a>` corresponding to a link
in the navbar. The whole `<ul>` is  wrapped in `<nav>` tags for accessibility and ease of styling.

@Conclusion üéâ
With that, we have reached the end of our journey together. You are now ready to conquer the internet using Kobayashi!
