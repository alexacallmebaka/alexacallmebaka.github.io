Welcome to my corner of the World Wide Web! I am an aspiring computer scientist and mathematician, amateur photographer,
anime nerd, chronic user of emojis, perpetual music listener, and enjoyer of tasty food.

There are all sorts of fun things to do here:

- Peruse my [projects|/projects].
- Check out my [photo gallery|/photos].
- Visit my [quote board|/quotes].
- Listen to me yap during [technical talks|/talks].

If you don't like it here 😭, I also exist in [a couple of other places online|/where]. You
could also check out what [my friends|./pals] are up to.
