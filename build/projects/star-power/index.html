<h1> Path Finding Star Power 🤩</h1>
<p>
Recently, I had the pleasure of taking a course in Graph Theory from the lovely <a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://rhodges-math.github.io/">Professor Reuven Hodges</a>
at the University of Kansas. As a capstone of the course, I was tasked with an independent project that involved the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reading an academic paper.
</li>
<li>
Writing a short summary of said paper.
</li>
<li>
Implementing an algorithm from the paper.
</li>
<li>
Giving a short talk in-class over the paper.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For my project, I used it as an excuse to finally get acquainted with the A* algorithm. A* is a heuristic algorithm
for finding the minimum cost path between two vertices in a directed, weighted graph. Therefore, the paper I chose was
<a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1968.300136">&quot;A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination of Minimum Cost Paths&quot;</a>
by Hart, Nilsson, and Raphel which is the original paper that proposed and proved A*.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Read my <a class="local-asset" href="/media/reports/a_star.pdf">report</a>.
</li>
<li>
Check out my <a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/alexacallmebaka/star-power">implementation</a>.
</li>
<li>
Flick through the <a class="local-asset" href="/media/slides/a_star_talk_deck.pdf">slide deck</a> from my talk.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My implementation of A* is also capable of of producing animations of the algorithm being run <em>as</em> it finds the shortest path
using 3Blue1Brown&apos;s <a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a> library. For my talk, I rendered a <a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://youtu.be/DK7QzVtlvz0">basic example</a> 
using the cycle of six vertices with random weights and heuristic values as well as a <a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://youtu.be/wjk-TryQzgs">more complex example</a>.
For the latter, I am modeling a road trip from Lawrence, KS to Bartlesville, OK constrained to only use specific highways.
The edge weights use the driving distance between cities on <a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>, and the heuristics 
were calculated by measuring the distance between cities in miles using <a class="remote" target="_blank"  href="https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/">Google Earth Pro</a>.
