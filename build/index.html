<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>
This website was built using <a href="https://github.com/alexacallmebaka/kobayashi">Kobayashi</a>, a static site generator
that I have created for the specific purpose of building this site! Right now, it only creates very basic sites like this one,
but as it gains support for more features my site will evolve as well.
